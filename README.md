I have been with IBM for almost 8 years. I have worked in multiple areas, including service delivery, product management, and developer advocacy. My roles have involved data science, process improvement, lean six sigma, agile, project management, finance, and event management.

Before IBM I was in the healthcare industry working directly with patients, insurance companies, and interested parties to improve patient care.

Above all else, I am a wife and a proud mother of 3 beautiful children.
