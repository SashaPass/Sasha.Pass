I have been with IBM for 8 years and have worked across many business units including IT Service Delivery, Product Management, and most currently Developer Ecosystems. I have lead many initiatives that involve agile methodologies, business transformation, process improvement, lean six sigma, finance and operations, and event management. I am known for my effective agile project leadership, organizing a team toward a common goal, and “getting things done”

Before IBM, I was in the healthcare and insurance industry working directly with patients, insurance companies, and stakeholders to improve patient care.

My most recent projects include:
- [Call for Code for Racial Justice](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/racial-justice/)
- [Call for Code](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/)
- [Open Source Community Grant](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/pionerasdev-wins-ibm-oscg-increase-participation-women-programming/)
- [Build Smart on Kubernetes World Tour](https://developer.ibm.com/openshift-world-tour/)

I have also worked in the healthcare industry working directly with patients, insurance companies, and stakeholders with a goal to improve patient care.
