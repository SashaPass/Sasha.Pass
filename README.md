# about-me
During my 5 years at IBM I have gained significant experience in Data Analytics and Project Management. I have worked with service delivery teams and software product teams to implement meaningful business analysis, process improvement, defect prevention, and transformation initiatives.
I also have 3 years experience in Healthcare and Insurance working directly with patients, insurance companies, and interested parties to improve patient care.
